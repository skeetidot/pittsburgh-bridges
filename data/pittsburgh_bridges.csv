41,31st Street Bridge,Arch,1928,,40.463013,-79.975943,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/31st_Street_1928.jpg,Todd Wilson,"The Thirtieth Street Bridge’s replacement was constructed at Thirty-first Street in 1927–1928. The Thirty-First Street Bridge crossed both Allegheny River channels and Herr’s Island. It was designed by Allegheny County Department of Public Works engineers Vernon Covell and Norman Brown. The bridge was similar to the nearby Washington Crossing (Fortieth Street) Bridge, built four years prior, but it was simpler in design.

Pittsburgh’s art commission rejected the Thirty-first Street Bridge’s proposed through-truss design in 1923, preferring arches beneath the road and unobstructed views from the deck. This desire required a longer, costlier bridge that could not directly connect to Herr’s Island."
43,43rd Street (Ewalt Street) Bridge,Wooden Covered Truss,1870,1924,40.475208,-79.966726,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/43rd_Street_1870.jpg,Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh,"In 1870, a covered wooden toll bridge was constructed across the Allegheny River connecting 43rd (Ewalt) Street in Lawrenceville with Millvale Borough. It was declared an obstruction to navigation in 1917 because of its short spans and low vertical clearance. In 1922, severe winds pushed it out of plumb. The roof was removed, and the bridge was anchored with steel bracing until its replacement opened in 1924."
32,Andy Warhol Bridge (Seventh Street Bridge),Suspension,1926,,40.4466,-79.99978,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Seventh_Street_Andy_Warhol_1926.jpg,Todd Wilson,"In 1917, the US secretary of war mandated the replacement of low Allegheny River Bridges, including the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Street Bridges. The Municipal Art Commission vetoed initial designs, preferring three identical suspension bridges that minimized structural members above the bridge decks, preserving views of the city from the bridges.

Previous Allegheny River suspension bridges had experienced problems with cable slippage at
their anchorages. With buildings and an elevated railroad along the Allegheny’s downtown side, deep excavation for anchorages was unpractical. County engineers chose a self-anchored suspension design, never before tried in America, but similar to the 1915 Cologne-Deutz Bridge
in Germany. The American Bridge Company built the bridges as cantilevered trusses, keeping the river channel clear for navigation.

The Sixth Street Bridge was completed in 1928 and the Seventh and Ninth Street bridges in 1926. Known as the “Three Sisters,” the bridges have received many awards and commendations and have been featured in movies.

They are now named after baseball legend Roberto Clemente, artist Andy Warhol, and environmentalist Rachel Carson."

After years of agitation, the Brady Street Bridge was built as Pittsburgh’s first free river bridge. It was constructed in 1895–1896 by the Schultz Bridge & Iron Company.

The Brady Street Bridge experienced problems with piers cracking soon after it opened. By 1909,
the northern river pier, visible here in the background, had settled 16 inches. By the 1960s, the Brady Street Bridge was deteriorating structurally and unable to meet growing traffic demands. Its replacement, the Birmingham Bridge, opened in 1976. The Brady Street Bridge was demolished on Memorial Day 1978."

Samuel S. Brown. The five-span Parker through truss bridge opened around 1897, connecting the bustling steel town of Homestead with Pittsburgh’s East End. The 1,300-foot-long bridge carried trolleys, pedestrians, carriages, and, later, automobiles.

By the 1920s, Brown’s Bridge was a bottleneck. The nine-foot lanes were unsuitable for traffic
serving the Homestead Steel Works. Approximately 180 trains per day blocked rail crossings in
Homestead for an average of two hours per day. After the 1937 Pittsburgh-Homestead High Level
Bridge opened downstream, Brown’s Bridge was dropped into the river, span by span,"

The bridge was Pittsburgh’s first tied-arch bridge. Providing a higher clearance than its predecessor, the 1,996-foot bridge has long approaches over streets and railroad tracks at both ends. Civic bodies, such as Pittsburgh’s art commission, requested that architects oversee the bridge’s design, advocating that civic bridges should be not just functional, but also beautiful. Warren & Wetmore of New York, with associate engineer H.G. Balcom, was commissioned to design the bridge. It features monumental pylons holding bronze armillary spheres by sculptor Leo Lentilli. The bridge was renamed for Pittsburgh-born historian David McCullough in 2012."

The main Pennsylvania-truss span was 517 feet long, one of the longest simple spans built anywhere at the time. The Glenwood Bridge carried trolleys until 1964. Frustrated by the lack of progress on its replacement, vandals damaged the wooden bridge deck in 1964, and protesting residents blocked the bridge for three days. The bridge was repaired and reopened until its replacement opened in 1968."

Pennsylvania Railroad project to bypass Pittsburgh’s congestion. Constructing a 523-foot main-
channel span with 65-foot-tall trusses 75 feet above the river required an innovative solution, since the river had to remain open for commercial navigation. The river’s main-channel span was built alongside Brunot’s Island and floated into place on barges.

The 1890 Ohio Connecting Railroad Bridge at Brunot’s Island was one of the longest bridges in America when it was built. It consisted of 29 spans, for a total length of over 4,500 feet. The railroad began to consider replacing and widening the bridge in 1910. "

The company faced the challenge of satisfying navigational interests that controlled the Monongahela while designing an economical bridge. The resulting suspension bridge had an 800-foot main span and a vertical clearance of up to 83 feet above low water. Land at the Point had to be raised to form the bridge approach.  Unlike other suspension bridges, the catenaries were stiffened by trusses, allowing the bridge to be built for half the cost of comparable bridges. "

The bridge became “The Bridge to Nowhere” in the 1960s until one of its North Side ramps was completed in 1969. The other was completed in 1986, and the envisioned highway connections were completed in 1991.

After over 40 years of planning, the Renaissance I vision for the Point was fulfilled with the completion of the Fort Duquesne Bridge in 1969 and Point State Park in 1974. The Point became part of Pittsburgh’s identity, a public space uniting engineering, urban planning, landscape architecture, and art.  "

This replaced the Union Bridge, which was demolished in 1907. The American Bridge Company constructed the northern span first, then the southern span. The two spans were constructed at different times in order to keep the river channel open for navigation.

The Manchester Bridge opened to traffic on August 8, 1915. It featured two 531-foot-long Pennsylvania truss spans, among the longest in America, and eight concrete-arch approach spans. The original plan called for stone portals to be built at each end of the trusses, allowing the trusses to be extended to end vertically. However, stone portals were determined to be too costly, so metal sculptures were added to the steel portals instead. The Pittsburgh side depicted pioneer scout Christopher Gist, Pittsburgh’s coat of arms, and Chief Guyasuta. The north side depicted a millworker and a coal miner."

In the early 1900s, no vehicular bridges existed between Pittsburgh’s Point and Sewickley, a distance of nearly 12 miles. After over two years of construction, the McKees Rocks Bridge was dedicated on August 19, 1931. The 5,900-foot-long bridge was one of the largest structures in the country. The bridge design paid tribute to New York City’s 1916 Hell Gate Bridge, which was believed to be the largest bridge constructed by Carnegie Steel when built. The McKees Rocks Bridge’s design is also similar to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which opened seven months later."

project to upgrade Route 8 and Route 28, bypassing the boroughs of Etna and Sharpsburg. It was
named after Robert D. Fleming, a politician from Sharpsburg who served for over 30 years."
33,Roberto Clemente Bridge (Sixth Street Bridge),Suspension,1928,,40.4456,-80.00336,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Sixth_Street_Roberto_Clemente_1928.jpg,Todd Wilson,"In 1917, the US secretary of war mandated the replacement of low Allegheny River Bridges, including the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Street Bridges. The Municipal Art Commission vetoed initial designs, preferring three identical suspension bridges that minimized structural members above the bridge decks, preserving views of the city from the bridges.

Previous Allegheny River suspension bridges had experienced problems with cable slippage at
their anchorages. With buildings and an elevated railroad along the Allegheny’s downtown side, deep excavation for anchorages was unpractical. County engineers chose a self-anchored suspension design, never before tried in America, but similar to the 1915 Cologne-Deutz Bridge
in Germany. The American Bridge Company built the bridges as cantilevered trusses, keeping the river channel clear for navigation.

He designed a low-cost replacement bridge for the maintenance-intensive Allegheny Aqueduct using wire rope, and he successfully lobbied the canal company to build the bridge. He invented a mechanized process to band wire ropes together into cables to improve rigidity. Roebling’s 1845 aqueduct was an immediate success, launching his renowned bridge-engineering career.

Once the railroad arrived in Pittsburgh, and the Fort Wayne Railroad Bridge was built just downstream, the aqueduct became obsolete. It was demolished in 1861."

The company became the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne & Chicago Railway, which replaced the wooden bridge in 1864 with a wrought iron lattice-girder (pictured). By 1900, the bridge had to be replaced, because it could not carry the heavier locomotives. The superstructure was shifted to temporary piers built next to the bridge so rail traffic could continue while its replacement was constructed from 1901 to 1904."

Ferris, Kaufman & Company designed the Baltimore truss superstructure (pictured) in 1890. A year later, Ferris began designing the Ferris wheel, which debuted in 1893.

The 1890 Hand (Ninth) Street metal-truss bridge was constructed around the 1839 covered 
bridge to maintain traffic and toll revenue during construction. The new bridge was 12 inches
higher—not enough to solve navigation issues. Demolition was not supposed to occur until after
the new Seventh Street Bridge opened, but the original 1839 piers were rapidly deteriorating. 
Demolition began early in 1925."

After much public pressure, the bridge was replaced by a larger structure, completed in 1927. The city’s art commission mandated a design complementary to the Manchester Bridge to create a more unified appearance at the Point. The bridge needed a long span over the river, and its approaches had to tie into existing infrastructure. Engineers and architects devised a unique cantilever truss design for the Point Bridge, with the road deck hung below the trusses. This allowed the long span over the river to have the gently curved top mandated by the city’s art commission. The architectural journal of the time, the Charette, compared the design to the Pitt Panther. The bridge was demolished in 1970 as part the Renaissance I urban renewal project that included the creation of Point State Park."

It was replaced by a steel truss bridge (pictured) in 1904. The bridge had a Pennsylvania truss main span flanked by a Parker truss to the north and Pratt trusses to the south. The bridge was designed by the Pittsburgh Department of Public Works and constructed by the American Bridge Company.

The Allegheny Department of Public Works anticipated increased traffic along Tenth Street, due to the 1927 opening of the Armstrong Tunnel and the 1935 opening of lower Mount Washington (McArdle) Roadway. The county decided to replace the Monongahela bridge between the tunnel and roadway. The 1904 bridge was demolished in 1931, and a new suspension bridge was completed in 1933."

49,Smithfield Street Bridge,Through Truss,1883,,40.435,-80.00204,Monongahela,Photos/Monongahela/Smithfield_Street_1883.jpg,Todd Wilson,"The Monongahela Bridge Company authorized construction of a new suspension bridge with
longer spans in 1880 to replace Roebling’s 1846 bridge. The severe winter of 1880–1881 halted pier construction. The company was reorganized, and the new management hired Gustav Lindenthal to design a truss bridge using the unfinished piers. The lenticular truss design was chosen, because the bridge company hoped to expand the bridge to carry rail traffic. Lenticular trusses used less material than other trusses and were thought to have a pleasing appearance appropriate for an urban setting.

The Smithfield Street Bridge opened in 1883 and was a landmark from the start. Engineer Gustav Lindenthal became known for designing unconventional bridges that bucked trends with aesthetically pleasing structural forms influenced by his appreciation of art. Most early 1880s bridges were made from wrought iron, but Lindenthal specified that the highest quality open-hearth steel be used. The bridge is the longest-spanning lenticular truss in the United States and is a National Historic Landmark. Lindenthal went on to design other noted bridges, including New York’s Hell Gate and Queensboro Bridges. In 1902, he became New York’s commissioner of bridges.

The Smithfield Street Bridge has been widened, altered, and modernized several times and has served streetcar and vehicular traffic."

26,Third Sixth Street Bridge,Through Truss,1892,1927,40.4456,-80.00336,Allegheny,Photos/Allegheny/Sixth_Street_1893.jpg,Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh,"By the 1890s, Roebling’s Sixth Street Bridge was unable to safely carry the heavier electric streetcars. The Allegheny River Bridge Company held a design competition to replace the Roebling bridge. Primary criteria were aesthetics and strength. An inverted-arch design was initially chosen, but it was later changed to a two-span Pennsylvania truss. Famed engineer Theodore Cooper designed the new bridge, fabricated by the Union Bridge Company. The new bridge was build next to Roebling's suspension bridge, allowing the old bridge to remain open during construction. Construction took 95 days.

In 1917, the secretary of war mandated the replacement of low Allegheny River bridges, including the 1893 Sixth Street Bridge. The bridge was dismantled in 1927 onto barges and floated along the river to be reused over the Ohio River to connect Coraopolis and Neville Island. The bridge lasted there until 1994."

It connected Allegheny City (now Pittsburgh’s North Side) with the tip of the Point. The 1875 bridge was the last wooden covered river bridge built in Pittsburgh. It had grand Italianate, neo-Renaissance portals with simulated stonework. The bridge was a hindrance to navigation on the Allegheny River, as its clearance dropped to as little as seven feet when the water was high. A petition to the secretary of war in 1902 resulted in the bridge being declared an obstruction to navigation. On appeal, the Supreme Court ruled the bridge had to be raised or razed. The bridge was demolished in 1907. "
